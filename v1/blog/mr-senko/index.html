                <a href="http://mrsenko.com/v1/blog/mr-senko/2016/05/18/triggering-automatic-dependency-testing/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Triggering Automatic Dependency Testing">
                    <h2>Triggering Automatic Dependency Testing</h2>
                </a>
            </header>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/strazar">Strazar</a> (from Bulgarian for sentinel)
helps you monitor upstream sources
and once a new package version is found your <code>.travis.yml</code> environment is updated
and the changes committed to GitHub which automatically triggers a new build!
This approach relies on having a good test suite, but you already have that
covered, right ?</p>
<p><em>Strazar</em> was inspired by Forbes Lindesay's <em>GitHub Automation</em> talk
at DEVit Conf 2015 and we're very excited to announce this release days before
this year's DEVit Conf!</p>
<h2>What is currently supported</h2>
<p>In its initial release <em>Strazar</em> only supports <a href="http://pypi.python.org">PyPI</a>,
Travis-CI and GitHub. We already have written the code to detect new
<a href="http://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com">NPM</a> packages
and that will land in the next versions.
However we also found the wonderful <a href="http://libraries.io">libraries.io</a>
service which is already aware of many more package repositories so we'll
try to integrate <em>Strazar</em> with it in the future.</p>
<p>We've started with Travis-CI because this is what we use but support for
other CI environments is very easy to add. <em>Strazar</em> calculates all
possible combinations between package names and their versions and writes
them to a text file. To add another CI environment we only need to parse
and write the file in the correct format.</p>
<h2>Installation and configuration</h2>
<p>To install <em>Strazar</em> execute</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install strazar
</pre></div>


<p>Then configure the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable. This token needs
the <code>public_repo</code> or <code>repo</code> permission in order to push commits to
your repositories.</p>
<h2>Prepare .travis.yml</h2>
<p><em>Strazar</em> uses the variable format <code>_PACKAGE_NAME</code> where the 
variable name starts with an under-score followed by the capitalized
package name. All hyphens are converted to under-scores as well.
We advise that your <code>.travis.yml</code> files follow the same convention.
This is how <em>Strazar</em>'s own <code>.travis.yml</code> looks like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">language</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">python</span>
<span class="n">python</span><span class="o">:</span>

</pre></div>


<h2>How to monitor PyPI</h2>
<p>PyPI doesn't provide web-hooks so we examine the RSS feed for packages of
interest based on configuration settings. To start monitoring PyPI execute
the following code from a cron job (here at Mr. Senko we do it every hour)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">strazar</span>

<span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;GITHUB_TOKEN&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;xxxxxxxxx&#39;</span>
<span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;PyYAML&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>

            <span class="s1">&#39;args&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
                <span class="s1">&#39;GITHUB_REPO&#39;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;MrSenko/strazar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                <span class="s1">&#39;GITHUB_BRANCH&#39;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;master&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                <span class="s1">&#39;GITHUB_FILE&#39;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;.travis.yml&#39;</span>
            <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="p">],</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">strazar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">monitor_pypi_rss</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>config</code> dict uses package names as 1st level keys. If you are interested
in a particular package add it here. All other packages detected from the RSS
feed will be ignored. If your project depends on multiple packages you have to
list all of them as 1st level keys in <code>config</code> and duplicate the key values.</p>
<p>The key value is a list of call-back methods and arguments to execute once a
new package has been published online. If two or more repositories depend on
the same package then add them as values to this list.</p>
<p>The <code>strazar.update_github</code> call-back knows how to commit to your source repo
which will automatically trigger a new CI build.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p><em>Strazar</em> is provided as open source for everyone to use.
At Mr. Senko we will do our best to accommodate every need and merge patches
and feature requests as they come in.

                <a href="http://mrsenko.com/v1/blog/mr-senko/2016/05/12/ab-testing-with-jinja2-and-pelican/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to A/B Testing with Jinja2 and Pelican">
                    <h2>A/B Testing with Jinja2 and Pelican</h2>
                </a>
            </header>

            <p>A/B testing is a randomized experiment with two variants,
which are the control and variation in the controlled experiment.
In this article we're going to present a solution which works with
<em>Pelican</em> and other <em>Jinja2</em> based static site generators.</p>
<h2>The markup</h2>
<p>In statically generated websites you either have content or templates.
We've been interested in encoding A/B experiments in templates and didn't
find a solution so we made our own.
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/jinja-ab">jinja-ab</a> is an A/B testing extension
for <em>Jinja2</em>. It allows you to encode experiments in your templates and renders
the experiment selected by the <code>AB_EXPERIMENT</code> environment variable. <strong>control</strong>
is the default experiment name if <code>AB_EXPERIMENT</code> is not specified!
The syntax looks like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">experiment</span> <span class="nv">control</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x">This is the control</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endexperiment</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">experiment</span> <span class="nv">v1</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x">This is version 1</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endexperiment</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Rendering and output control</h2>
<p><em>jinja-ab</em> deals with rendering the template string based on the value of
<code>AB_EXPERIMENT</code>. It is up to you to decide what to do with the result.
At <a href="http://MrSenko.com">Mr. Senko</a> we use <em>Pelican</em> and created the complimentary
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab">pelican-ab</a> plugin. To enable the plugin
simply add it in your <code>pelicanconf.py</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">PLUGIN_PATHS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;path/to/pelican-ab&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">PLUGINS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;pelican_ab&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After encoding your experiments into the theme templates you can generate the
resulting HTML files by running the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">AB_EXPERIMENT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;v1&quot;</span> make html
</pre></div>


<p>When rendering experiments the resulting HTML files are saved under
<code>OUTPUT_PATH</code> plus the experiment name. For example 'output/v1', 'output/v2',
etc. The control experiments are rendered directly under <code>OUTPUT_PATH</code>.
For example the control directory structure of this blog looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>output/
|-- blog
|   |-- 2016
|   |   | ...
|   |-- archives
|   |-- atodorov
|   |   `-- ...
|   |-- mr-senko
|   |   `-- ...
|   `-- tags
|       | ...
|-- feeds
|-- images
|-- js
|-- support
`-- theme
</pre></div>


<p>After rendering an experiment called 'v1' the directory structure looks like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>output/v1/
|-- blog
|   |-- 2016
|   |   | ...
|   |-- archives
|   |-- atodorov
|   |   `-- ...
|   |-- mr-senko
|   |   `-- ...
|   `-- tags
|       | ...
`-- support
</pre></div>


<p>Only content output is saved under the new directory because content it
rendered using the templates which we want to A/B test. This is how <em>pelican-ab</em>
works for the moment.</p>
<p>This plugin also automatically updates the <code>Content.url</code> and <code>URLWrapper.url</code>
class properties from <em>Pelican</em> so that things like <code>{{ article.url }}</code>
and <code>{{ author.url }}</code> will point to URLs from the same experiment.</p>
<p>In other words each experiment
produces its own HTML and URL structure, using the experiment name as
prefix. Once a user lands on
a page from experiment "v1" all links to other content will also point to
"v1", for example 'blog/about-me.html' becomes 'v1/blog/about-me.html', etc.
This will help you gather more information from the experiment because
all your internal URLs are under the same experiment,
using the same HTML template variation.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> wherever you use the <code>{{ SITEURL }}</code> template tag without pointing
to the content url property the values will not be changed. This means
all your CSS, JavaScript and images will continue to work without being
duplicated under the experiment directory.</p>
<h2>Testing and publishing experiments</h2>
<p>For local development use the command <code>AB_EXPERIMENT="xy" make regenerate</code>
or <code>AB_EXPERIMENT="xy" make html</code> together with <code>make serve</code> to review the
experiments. When you are ready to publish them online execute the following
sequence of commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>rm -rf output/
make github
<span class="nv">AB_EXPERIMENT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;01&quot;</span> make github
<span class="nv">AB_EXPERIMENT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;02&quot;</span> make github
</pre></div>


<p>By default <code>publishconf.py</code> contains <code>DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = True</code>
which causes <em>pelican-ab</em> to raise an exception. The problem is that you need
to execute <code>make publish</code> or <code>make github</code> for each experiment you'd like to
publish online. When <code>DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</code> is True the previous contents
will be deleted and <strong>ONLY</strong> that variation will be published!
This will break your website because everything will be gone!</p>
<h2>A/B testing</h2>
<p>Now that we finally got our experiments encoded and rendered it is time to
re-route some of the web traffic to them and analyze the results. <em>pelican-ab</em>
is not designed to deal with this, you will have to use external tools to
control how your web traffic is redirected to your experiments and what sort
of results are collected. Our favorite ones are <em>LuckyOrange</em> and <em>Optimizely</em>.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p><em>jinja-ab</em> and <em>pelican-ab</em> are provided as open source for everyone to use.
At Mr. Senko we will do our best to accommodate every need and merge patches
and feature requests as they come in.

                    <h2>Why Your Open Source Bugs Will Not Be Fixed</h2>
                </a>
            </header>

            <p>Here at Mr. Senko we've been researching why many bugs reported against
open source projects don't get fixed. This is not surprising given that many
contributors to open source use the "scratch your own itch" principle.
We've been talking to various people why some bugs are left open. We've
reached both open source maintainers and users and here are the results.</p>
<h2>Time is Code</h2>
<p>The core of the problem revolves around time constraints. Open source developers
are limited by the time they have to work on the project, even more so if they
are volunteers. Their focus is on critical and high priority issues and driving
the project through its roadmap and they don't have enough time for you.
The side effect of this is that many smaller
issues are dealt with only if there is free time left.
Some factors to consider here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not being able to reproduce the bug because it requires a particular
environment or is not explained very well;</li>
<li>The bug is not immediately affecting the developer and they have
little incentive to fix it;</li>
<li>There is a limited number of users who are affected by the bug and it
is not getting the priority or visibility it needs to be fixed by the
developer;</li>
<li>Reviewing pull requests and discussing contributions is integral part of
open source. Usually only the core developers of the project are doing this
which limits even more their time to work on other issues;</li>
<li>Popular projects, especially with exponential user-base growth are flooded
with feature requests and minor priority bug reports. Although these will
help the project become better in the long-run they reduce the free time
available to developers because they constantly have to review and keep track
of all these reports while still working on the current version;</li>
<li>Lack of adequate testing or sufficient test coverage makes it harder to
accept new features and fix existing bugs;</li>
</ul>
<p>You see where this is going - the more problems there are, the less time there
is to fix them and the problems pile up even more, shrinking the available time
as we go along.</p>
<p>Larger and more popular projects tend to exhibit more severe problems arising
from the above factors. Of the top 1000 Python, Ruby and Node.js packages
the average time an issue spends between open and closed is around 30 days,
some projects going to the extremes of 100s of days. All of this because the
developer to user ratio in these projects is too low.
On the other hand smaller communities are usually more responsive and
easier to work with. From our experience single developer projects tend to
respond within 2 days on average.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a smaller project works for you and the developer is responsive enough
don't switch to a more popular one unless needed;</li>
<li>If you have the technical capability provide help in code review and
pull requests discussion. Often spotting formatting mistakes or instructing
the contributor to squash their commits, provide short description in the docs
or a few tests will go a long way in helping the core group of developers;</li>
<li>Provide clear steps to reproduce a bug, even better provide automated test
case for it. If you require a specialized setup try to provide a system where
the bug is present so the developer can debug live;</li>
<li>Provide QA expertise by writing and executing test plans against new versions
of the project, even better contribute automated tests for that;</li>
<li>Spend some time to investigate and increase test coverage. You may be using
the non-covered code and the next upgrade will break it without tests;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Leadership, Management and Politics</h2>
<p>Less frequently cited problems are in the fields of leadership, project
management and community politics.
On the extreme end here we see projects which are not under active development
anymore but are still widely adopted by the general public. This is the case
with some of Node.js most downloaded packages. In the same category are also
projects which do have some development community(possibly with write access)
but it doesn't quite understand what the source code is doing and is not
able to promptly fix bugs or is unwilling to do so.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Become the secondary (or even primary) maintainer of the project if you have
the technical knowledge. If you want to step down announce your intentions
loud and clear and allow some time for the transition to take place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Management and politics are often a problem in large and popular projects
where every developer has their own vision of how the project should evolve
and all of these visions need to be brought together and steered into a single
direction. In projects which are corporately sponsored there are trusted
developers who perform these tasks. In bigger projects there could even be
a management board who decides on where the project is going next and how
developer resources will be best utilized. For projects backed by a foundation
this is certainly the case.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<p>Provide a management capacity who will serve on the project's board. That
person will help raise visibility to your particular issues but their general
task will be to help the project move forward. If they fail to do so the
relationship will simply not work. Some projects have a fixed term for board
members to prevent a single entity overtaking control of the project.</p>
<h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
<p>Being humans developers are not prone to simple facts that make their work
non-effective or slow.</p>
<p>We've been told that some developers don't understand the bug-fix or more likely
the software development lifecycle. It sounds like we're talking about
inexperienced developers who managed to create a popular open source project
alone. Or maybe we're talking about developers who come from the start-up
scene while users are coming from the enterprise world and are used to working
in a different manner ? Either-way both parties have to learn from each other
and not allow tempers to rise too much.</p>
<p>Others have claimed that some developers don't know how to ask for outside help or
are reluctant to give up control of their projects to external contributors.
We don't have data about how often this happens but apparently often enough
to be visible.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<p>As a user (or developer) clearly communicate your intentions and expectations.
If you feel the other party doesn't quite understand you explain where are you
coming from. It is possible that you working environment and mental processes
are quite alien to them and they don't see the point in your words. If there is
a local technology user group or a near-by event then go meet the other guy
and buy them a beer.</p>
<h2>Why Should You Care</h2>
<p>If you are still reading then chances are you've experienced some of these
problems yourself. We certainly have seen quite a few from the list above.
The bottom line is that whenever you have problems with a particular open
source project don't expect somebody to help you. Open source comes at a
price and it is being able to help yourself or fix your own problems. Kind
of like buying a new car without a warranty and a mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>Practical example - Sphinx</strong></p>
<p>Sphinx <a href="https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/1902">PR #1902</a> introduces
new features to the inheritance diagram plugin but also adds new tests for
the existing code base as well as new tests for the proposed modifications.
6 months later and the PR is still open, not even undergone code review.
Later in commit 4c4450 the core devel team changes a parameter type in one
of the functions used by the inheritance diagram plugin. Not having any tests
for the caller code they make a backward incompatible change which is still
broken in the master branch. For the fix see 
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/sphinx/commit/d67fee57f000385cb48dba6cb1c725ddb0e0e2c0">commit d67fee</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Practical example - dnf-plugins-core</strong></p>
<p>The <em>dnf download</em> command in Fedora had a test suite which used badly
designed test stubs. They have been redesigned in
<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-core/pull/118">PR #118</a>
but developers requested the refactoring be merged together with
<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-core/pull/113">PR #113</a>
which also adds new functionality. 2 months afterwards comes
<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-core/commit/fe130669ffc4c1d6eba8f10cda35ab4d803d5a3d">commit fe1306</a>
which changes behavior in the same plugin. The badly designed test stubs
ignored the change silently and it landed in the master branch. The newly
redesigned tests broke immediately but they were still under review and not
merged until 1 month later.</p>
<p>Many developers and companies consuming open source software are OK
(or OK-ish) with this state of art. They've accepted that they have to
fix their own problems or work around them when the time comes.
This is how the open source is expected to work, isn't it ?</p>

do so please consider <a href="http://mrsenko.com/v1/subscribe.html">subscribing to Mr. Senko</a>!

            <p>Hello everyone, <a href="http://MrSenko.com">Mr. Senko</a> flew to Brussels for his first
public appearances and we are very excited about this. He visited
<a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> to get an update on the latest news in open source
and scored the highest ping-pong score for
<a href="https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/693762736765976576">BBC Open Source</a>
on Sunday!
He also learned a bit about <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> with the
Belgian Elixir Study group, attended a panel on open source and start-ups
organized by <a href="http://europe.startupbus.com">The Startup Bus</a>
and made lots of new friends. Here are some of
the details and links for further reading.</p>
<p><img alt="Ping-pong with computers" src="/images/bbc_ping_pong.jpg" title="Ping-pong with computers" /></p>
<h2>Friday - Day 0</h2>
<p>Friday was a fruitful day for Mr. Senko. It started with a meeting at
<a href="http://betacowork">BetaCowork</a> - one of the co-working spaces in Brussels
and continued with a visit to
<a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/brussels2016/">Brussels Erlang Factory Lite</a>
where we learned a bit about Erlang and Elixir and even managed to create a
<a href="https://github.com/belgian-elixir-study-group/efl/pull/5">small pull request</a>
as part of the exercises. Funny enough, one of the organizers,
<a href="https://twitter.com/less_software">Yuri Leikind</a> was spot on to recognize our
Bulgarian accent.</p>
<p>BetaCowork was bursting with people who've come for FOSDEM. There was a GNOME
team and the Libre Office Italian team! The place is huge and is definitely
an alternative for the entrepreneurs who are tired of working from home! It
is also very close to ULB so next time you visit FOSDEM definitely check their
events schedule as well.</p>
<h2>Saturday - Day 1</h2>
<p>Saturday was the
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/">Testing and Automation</a>
day. The morning track showed us <a href="http://frida.re">Frida</a> - a tool
which injects JavaScript into existing processes and could be used for testing
interoperability with closed source applications. Another interesting use case
is overriding the standard <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> functions in order to automate testing
of interactive text based applications on Linux. Mr. Senko had the pleasure talking
to Frida's authors on both days. These are extremely tallented and knowledgeable
folks so definitely keep an eye on their work.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the room got packed when Marcin and Lukasz presented their
experience with
<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin">Jenkins Job DSL</a> plugin.
The plugin is very flexible and powerfull, using Groovy
as its programming language. The only drawback is that it is
sometimes too complex to use and requires a steep learning curve.
Regardless of this the only tools we know about related to
Jenkins as Code are the Jenkins Job DSL and Jenkins Job Builder plugins.</p>
<p>In the evening Mr. Senko visited a panel talk about
<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/startupbusaccelerate-the-impact-of-open-source-software-on-the-tech-industry-tickets-20869395925">the impact of open source on the tech industry</a>
at the second big co-workign space in Brussels - <a href="http://co-station.com">Co.Station</a>.
The place is in the city center so definitely worth to visit at any time.
Mr. Senko made quite a few new friends there and possibly found potential
pilot customers. We've also made contact with the organizers of
<a href="http://europe.startupbus.com">Startup Bus Europe</a> and hopefully we'll see
the bus coming to Sofia as well. And we also got invited to the first
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/setting-up-first-angular-conference-belgium-sam-vloeberghs">Angular.js conference in Belgium</a>
and with a bit of luck you'll see a talk from us in the summer.</p>
<h2>Sunday - Day 2</h2>
<p>Sunday was the lazy day. The only talk of interest to Mr. Senko was
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/tweaking_ruby_gc/">Tweaking Ruby GC parameters for speed and profit</a>
. The rest of the time was spent networking, collecting t-shirts,
reporting
<a href="https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/ticket/5085">a bug against Fedora Account System</a>
and meeting with old friends.</p>
<p><img alt="hammer down" src="/images/bbc_hammer_game.jpg" title="hammer down" /></p>
<p>In the early afternoon Mr. Senko played a few geeky games at the BBC Open Source
stand. BBC is developing the <a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk/">micro:bit</a> - a small computer which is intended to
teach programming to small children. With its help they has built a ping-pong
device which counts how many times you hit the ball.</p>
<p>In the second game you had to smash a
red circle with a foam hammer as soon as it lighted up. Mr. Senko managed to
win the first game and then lost the second one. He even got to test the device
and tried to crash it by scoring penalty points when the counter was still zero.
BBC definitely did their job right because the device didn't crash.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this report. See you at the next event!</p>
