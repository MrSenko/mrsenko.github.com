Here is a quick status report of my work for [Mr. Senko](http://MrSenko.com). During
May 2016 I've worked on:

* New feature: display social icons in index page header for
[pelican-clean-blog](https://github.com/gilsondev/pelican-clean-blog/pull/43);
* Enabled StatusCake Real User Monitoring (RUM) for
[Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex/pull/41);
* Worked on improving assets plugin support for
[Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex/pull/40)
after the original author didn't update their PR;
* Proposed several fixes for
[Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/pulls/atodorov)
to bugs labeled with the 3.7 milestone;
* Forked, merged and updated the
[pelican-octopress-theme]({filename}2016-05-25-pelican-octopress.markdown);
* Released
[Strazar]({filename}2016-05-18-automatic-dependency-testing-strazar.markdown) -
a monitoring tool that we use to automatically trigger new builds in Travis-CI;
* Started working on
[warehouse](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/pull/1203) - the new code
which will run PyPI.

Focusing on abandoned pull requests
-----------------------------------

While working on several issues I've noticed pull requests that were well
written but they had minor issues, for example code formatting. The code
review was done in the initial PR but the author didn't update their patches.
As a result of this the pull request stayed open for a long time.
I've also been focusing on issues and pull requests which were labeled for
a particular release but were left open for quite a long time. Hopefully
we'll see those releases coming out soon.

I hope you like my work and please
**subscribe to [Mr. Senko]({filename}pages/subscribe.html)!**
if need a faster response cycle for the open source libraries you use.
