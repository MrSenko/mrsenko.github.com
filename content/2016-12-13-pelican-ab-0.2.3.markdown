[pelican-ab](https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab) is an A/B testing plugin
for Pelican, the static site generator. It allows you to encode experiments in
your templates and renders the experiment selected by the `AB_EXPERIMENT`
environment variable.

Today we are releasing version `0.2.3` as an urgent bug fix update handling
internal changes in the latest version of Pelican.
In previous versions Pelican used the `JINJA_EXTENSIONS` setting to
configure additional Jinja2 modules. In version 3.7.0, released yesterday,
`JINJA_EXTENSIONS` has been replaced with the `JINJA_ENVIRONMENT` setting.
Version 0.2.3 of pelican-ab handles both cases and is able to work with older
and newer versions of Pelican!

This backward-incompatible change in Pelican has been automatically detected by our
monitoring tool
[Strazar]({filename}2016-05-18-automatic-dependency-testing-strazar.markdown),
which proves the value of automatic testing against the latest versions of
upstream dependencies!
