Hello everyone, welcome to [Mr. Senko](http://MrSenko.com)! We are a group of friends who have
been working with open source for the last 10 years. During this time we've
seen technologies come and go and hype projects becoming abandoned months later.
We've seen the pain when companies had to rewrite their software because of this
and the struggle to get your patches accepted upstream.
Don't you wish you had somebody who could take care of all the hassle for you?

Mr. Senko is our attempt at providing commercial support for open source projects,
specifically libraries which other companies use to build their products. As of now
we have diverse experience in Java, Python and JavaScript as well as my personal
experience with Quality Assurance.

In the next weeks and months we will be refining our value proposition and building
the team so we can offer you great technical support and expertise. We plan to blog
regularly about our progress and about technology and open source events in general! 
You can follow us at [@Mr_Senko](https://twitter.com/Mr_Senko) or tweet at the wizard
using the **#MrSenko** hashtag! 

Stay tuned for more news!
