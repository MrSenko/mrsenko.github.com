Details
-------

Django Chartit is a Django app that can be used to easily create charts from
the data in your database. The charts are rendered using `Highcharts` and
`jQuery` JavaScript libraries. Data in your database can be plotted as simple
line charts, column charts, area charts, scatter plots, and many more chart
types. Data can also be plotted as Pivot Charts where the data is grouped
and/or pivoted by specific column(s).


Updated upstream is now available which adds couple of improvements.
